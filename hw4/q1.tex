\begin{solution}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Let the variable $Y(t)$ be the number of clients arriving
            in time $T$ and let $Z(t)$ be the number of clients arriving
            when the station is empty in time $T$. $E[Z(t) \mid X(t) =
            x, Y(t) = y] = y - x$. Since $X$ and $Y$ are independent
            variables, this is the same as $E[Z(t)] = E[X(t)] -
            E[Y(t)]$, where $X(t) = 10 + \lambda T, Y(t) = (\mu_1 +
            \mu_2 + \mu_3)T$.

            Therefore, $Z(120) = 120(8 - 6) - 10 = 230$. Penalties are
            paid by classes 1 and 2, which occur proportionally to their
            respective rates, so the total penalty is $230(\frac{1 *
            3}{8} + \frac{1}{8 * 4}) = 93.4375$.

        \item
