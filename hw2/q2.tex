\begin{solution}

    \textbf{TODO: Clean this answer up extensively.}

    There are two possible events at any given service period: a
    customer could arrive, and a customer currently being served could
    finish. We'll call these, respectively, $\xi_0$ and $\xi_1$. Let $Y$
    be a random variable measuring the total number of customers either
    waiting or currently being serviced. When $Y=0$, only $\xi_0$ is
    possible, meaning that:

    \begin{align*}
    &P\lbrace Y = 1 \mid Y = 0\rbrace = P\lbrace\xi_0\rbrace \\
    &P\lbrace Y = 0 \mid Y = 0\rbrace = 1 - P\lbrace\xi_0\rbrace
    \end{align*}

    When $Y > 0$, the number of customers present can either grow by one
    ($\xi_0$), stay the same (no event or $\xi_0$ and $\xi_1$), or
    shrink by one ($\xi_1$).

    If \textbf{P} is a transition probability matrix specifying the
    probability that the number of customers will change from $i$
    customers to $j$ customers in a single service period, it can be
    defined:

    \begin{align*}
        \textbf{P}_{ij} = 
        \begin{cases}
            1 - \beta & i = j = 0 \\
            \beta & i = 0, j = 1 \\
            (1 - \alpha)\beta & j = i+1, i > 0\\
            (1 - \alpha)(1-\beta) + \alpha\beta & j=i>0\\
            (1 - \beta)\alpha & j = i - 1\\
            0 & \text{all other values of }i, j
        \end{cases}
    \end{align*}

    Where $i,j$ are non-negative integers.

\end{solution}
