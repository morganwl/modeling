\begin{solution}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\{X_n\}$ is a Markov chain, so long as $X_n$ encodes the
            result of the initial coin toss.

            \textbf{TO-DO: Work out the probabilities. The transition
                probabilities would be indexed from one of the two
                matrices dependent on the coin-toss component of the
            state.}

        \item This is also a Markov chain; the transition probabilities
            are conditioned on the coin toss.

            \textbf{TO-DO: Type up these probabilities.}
    \end{enumerate}
