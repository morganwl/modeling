\begin{solution}
    % type A: dominant
    % type a: recessive
    % p = probability of AA in population
    % q = probability of aa in population
    % r = probability of Aa in population

    Let $d$ be the probability that a single parent with a dominant
    phenotype will pass a recessive gene to their children. Because a
    parent with a recessive phenotype will pass a recessive gene on to
    their child w.p.1., $S_{10} = d$. Since $S_{11} = d * d$, we can
    show that $S_{11} = S_{10}$ without even calculating the probability
    for $d$.

    Because $AA$ is unable to transmit a recessive gene, and assuming
    the selection of genes to be transmitted is uniform, $d$ can be
    calculated as the probability of transmitting $a$ given $Aa$ times
    the probability of $Aa$ given $AA$ or $Aa$,
    $d = \frac{r}{2(p + r)}$.

    \begin{align*}
        \Prob(S_{11}) &= \left(\frac{r}{2(p+r)}\right)^2 \\
        \Prob(S_{10}) &= \frac{r}{2(p+r)}
    \end{align*}

\end{solution}
